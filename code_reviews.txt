One concept that is similar is to not criticize the submitter,
but point out flaws in the code and be communicative. Another point
that is similar is to respect the codebase and review for correctness.
The yelp one has a difference that it is more logical oriented while
the microsoft one goes more into ethics while reviewing code. The microsoft
one also gives more suggestions while the yelp one states clear guidelines
to follow when reviewing code.

I found this review beneficial because the user had a clear problem and then solutions
were presented that offered different angles to tackle the problem and also explained
why the user was having the problem. It was clear and concise.

I found this review to be not as useful because it is very confusing to understand
what the person reviewing was saying. The advice was not that helpful overall
and I think it could be improved if they offered a more clear solution.
